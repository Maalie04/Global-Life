        <strong><li>Adverse Selection:</li></strong>
        <p>
          Adverse selection is broadly defined as selection against the company.
          It includes the tendency of people with higher risks to seek or
          continue insurance to a greater extent than those with little or less
          risk. Adverse selection also includes the tendency of policyowners to
          take advantage of favorable options in insurance contracts.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Hazard:</li></strong>
        <p>
          A hazard is any factor, condition, or situation that creates an
          increased possibility that a peril (a cause of a loss) will actually
          occur.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Homogeneous Exposure Units: :</li></strong>
        <p>
          Homogeneous exposure units are similar objects of insurance that are
          exposed to the same group of perils.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Indemnity contract::</li></strong>
        <p>
          Contracts of indemnity attempt to return the insured to their original
          financial position.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Law of Large Numbers:</li></strong>
        <p>
          The law of large numbers is a fundamental principle of insurance that
          the larger the number of individual risks combined into a group, the
          more certainty there is in predicting the degree or amount of loss
          that will be incurred in any given period.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Loss:</li></strong>
        <p>
          Loss is the unintentional decrease in the value of an asset due to a
          peril.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Loss Exposure:</li></strong>
        <p>Loss exposure is the risk of a possible loss.</p>
        <strong><li>Moral Hazard:</li></strong>
        <p>
          Moral hazard is a hazard brought on by the effect of personal
          reputation, character, associates, personal living habits, financial
          responsibility, and environment, as distinguished from physical
          health, upon an individual's general insurability.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Morale Hazard:</li></strong>
        <p>
          Morale hazard is a hazard arising from indifference to loss because of
          the existence of insurance. Morale hazards are often associated with
          having a careless attitude.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Peril:</li></strong>
        <p>
          Peril is the immediate, specific event causing loss and giving rise to
          risk.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Physical Hazard:</li></strong>
        <p>
          Physical hazards are physical or tangible conditions existing in a
          manner that makes a loss more likely to occur.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Pure risk:</li></strong>
        <p>
          Pure risk is a type of risk that involves the chance of loss only;
          there is no opportunity for gain; it is insurable.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Reinsurance:</li></strong>
        <p>
          Reinsurance is the acceptance by one or more insurers, called
          reinsurers, of a portion of the risk underwritten by another insurer
          who has contracted for the entire coverage.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Risk:</li></strong>
        <p>
          Risk is the uncertainty regarding loss, the probability of a loss
          occurring for an insured or prospect.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Risk Avoidance:</li></strong>
        <p>
          Risk avoidance occurs when individuals evade risk entirely. It is the
          act of not doing something that could possibly cause a loss or the
          inactivity of participation in an event that may potentially cause a
          loss situation.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Risk Management:</li></strong>
        <p>
          Risk management is the process of analyzing exposures that create risk
          and designing programs to handle them is called risk management.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Risk Pooling/Loss sharing:</li></strong>
        <p>
          Risk pooling and loss sharing spread risk by sharing the possibility
          of loss over a large number of people. It transfers risk from an
          individual to a group.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Risk Reduction:</li></strong>
        <p>
          Risk reduction takes place when the chances of a loss are lessened, or
          the severity of a potential loss is minimized.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Risk Retention:</li></strong>
        <p>
          Risk retention is the act of analyzing the loss exposure presented by
          a risk and determining that the potential loss is acceptable. Risk
          retention is often associated with self-insurance.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Risk Transfer:</li></strong>
        <p>
          Risk transfer is the act of shifting the responsibility of risk to
          another in the form of an insurance contract.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Speculative Risk:</li></strong>
        <p>
          Speculative risk is a type of risk that involves the chance of both
          loss and gain; it is not insurable.
         
       
        <strong><li>Standard risks </li></strong>
        <p>are considered to have an average potential for loss.</p>
        <strong><li>Substandard risks</li></strong>
        <p> are considered to be a poor risk for the insurance company and have a higher potential for loss.</p>
