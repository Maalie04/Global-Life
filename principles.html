        <strong><li>Role of insuranance</li></strong>
        <p>For more than a century, insurance has been recognized as an essential element in an individual's or family's financial planning program. Insurance helps to reduce the financial uncertainty of the policyowner with regard to possible future losses. A financial planning program should include the individual or family's general and specific financial goals and a plan to achieve those objectives. This chapter will review the basic principles, nature, and legal concepts of insurance contracts.

            The concept of insurance, in generic terms, may be defined as the transfer of risk from one party to another through a legal contract. Insurance can also be defined as the transfer of risk through the pooling or accumulation of funds. When a person purchases insurance, that person (identified as the policyowner or applicant in insurance transactions) transfers the possibility of suffering a large financial loss to an insurerin return for paying a relatively small, contractually defined premium. Insurance spreads the risk of loss from one person to a large number of persons through the pooling of premiums. When the transfer of risk is accomplished by purchasing an insurance policy, the policyowner obtains a large quantity of coverage in return for a small fee (i.e., premium).</p>
        <strong><li>BENEFITS AND COSTS OF INSURANCE TO SOCIETY</li></strong>
        <p>Insurance evolved as a practical solution to economic uncertainties and losses. Most insurance contracts, including health insurance and property and casualty policies, pay off financial losses and reimburse the insured. They indemnify policyholders, which means the policies restore insureds to the financial position they enjoyed before the insured loss. Eliminating the possibility of an unplanned expense is arguably the most significant advantage of insurance contracts. Insurance also lessens the chance the person suffering loss will have to pay entirely for a loss out of their funds, thus allowing for the benefit of greater management of cash flow and providing for better loss control.

            Death may strike anyone prematurely. When death takes a family provider (i.e., breadwinner), surviving family members suffer if they are left without adequate income. Life insurance pays death benefits and creates an instant estate, regardless of when death occurs. On the other hand, when people face the unpleasant prospect of outliving their income, annuities can generate a lifetime income stream to help solve or alleviate this problem.</p>
        <strong><li>TYPES OF INSURANCE COMPANIES</li></strong>
        <p>There are many ways to classify organizations that provide insurance. Conventional methods of insurer classification include where the company is located, how the company is owned, or if the company is authorized in a given state. In the broadest of terms, insurance companies are typically classified as private/commercial and government. Within these two classes are many categories of insurance providers, as well as insurance plans and insurance producers. It is important to note that the company providing the insurance is called the insurer. The covered person is known as the insured.</p>
        <strong><li>TYPES OF INSURANCE COMPANIES</li></strong>
        <p>Private (Commercial) Insurance Companies

            Commercial insurers are private companies offering many lines of insurance. Some only sell life insurance and annuities, while others sell only accident and health insurance, or strictly property and casualty insurance. Companies that sell more than one line of insurance are known as multi-line insurers. A company that only sells one line of insurance is a monoline insurer. Stock and mutual companies can both be considered commercial insurers, and as such, both can write life, health, property, and casualty insurance.</p>
        <strong><li>Stock Companies Nonparticipating</li></strong>
        <p>A stock insurance company is a private organization, organized and incorporated under state laws for the purpose of making a profit for its stockholders (shareholders). It is structured the same as any corporation. Stockholders may or may not be policyholders. When declared, stock dividends are paid to stockholders. In a stock company, the directors and officers are responsible to the stockholders.

            Stock insurance companies issue nonparticipating insurance policies. Nonparticipating insurance policies do not allow policyholders to participate in the company's profits (i.e., receive dividends). As opposed to passing savings on to policyholders, stock companies look to grow their earned surplus or post-tax earnings not paid in dividends. Earnings retained by a company are considered equity and, as such, are owned by the shareholders. Nonparticipating insurance policies also do not allow policyholders to participate in electing the company's board of directors.</p>
            <strong><li>Mutual Companies - Participating</li></strong>
            <p>Mutual insurance companies are also organized and incorporated under state laws, but they have no stockholders. Instead, the owners are the policyholders. Anyone purchasing insurance from a mutual insurer is both a customer and an owner. He has the right to vote for members of the board of directors. Mutual companies are referred to as participating companies because the policyowners participate in dividends.

                By issuing participating policies that pay policy dividends, mutual insurers allow their policyowners to share in any company earnings (divisible surplus).
                
                The divisible surplus is the amount of earnings paid to policyowners as dividends after the insurance company sets aside funds required to cover reserves, operating expenses, and general business purposes. Essentially, policy dividends represent a refund of the portion of premium remaining after the company has set aside the necessary reserves and has made deductions for claims and expenses. Policy dividends can also include a share in the company's investment, mortality, and operating profits. Surpluses are typically distributed to policyowners on an annual basis.
                
                Occasionally, a stock company may be converted into a mutual company through a process called mutualization. Likewise, mutual companies can convert to stock companies through a process called demutualization. In the rare case of a stock insurance company issuing both participating and nonparticipating policies, the company is referred to as using a mixed plan.</p>
            <strong><li>Strong Assessment Mutual Insurers</li></strong>
            <p>Assessment mutual companies are classified by the way in which they charge premiums. A pure assessment mutual company operates on the basis of loss-sharing by group members. No premium is payable in advance. Instead, each member is assessed a portion of the losses that occur. An advance premium assessment mutual charges a premium at the beginning of the policy period. If the original premiums exceed the operating expenses and losses, the surplus is returned to the policyholders as dividends. However, if total premiums are not enough to meet losses, additional assessments are levied against the members. Typically, the amount of assessment that may be levied is limited either by state law or simply as a provision in the insurer's by-laws.</p>
            <strong><li>Risk Retention and Risk Purchasing Groups</li></strong>
            <p>A risk retention group (RRG) is a mutual insurance company formed to insure people in the same business, occupation, or profession (e.g., pharmacists, dentists, or engineers). These group-owned liability insurers assume and spread product liability and other forms of commercial liability risks among its members. This type of group is formed for the primary purpose of retaining or pooling risks. Risk retention groups are licensed in their state of domicile and are owned by their policyholders, who are business owners (who are also the shareholders). Once these groups are organized, they can offer membership to others who possess similar risks. A risk retention group or risk purchasing group only has to be licensed in one state but may insure members in any State.</p>
            <strong><li>Reciprocal Insurers</li></strong>
            <p>Similar to mutual insurers, reciprocal insurers are organized on the basis of ownership by their policyholders. However, with reciprocal insurers, it is the policyholders themselves who insure the other policyholders' risks. Each policyholder assumes a share of the risk brought to the company by others. An attorney-in-fact manages reciprocal insurers.</p>
            <strong><li>Reinsurers and Retention Limits</li></strong>
            <p>Reinsurers are a specialized branch of the insurance industry because they insure insurers. Reinsurance is an arrangement by which an insurance company transfers a portion of an assumed risk to another insurer. Usually, reinsurance occurs to limit the loss any one insurer would face should a very large claim become payable. Another reason for reinsurance is to enable a company to meet specific objectives, such as favorable underwriting or mortality results. The company transferring the risk is called the ceding company; the company assuming the risk is the reinsurer. The portion of the risk that the ceding insurer retains is called the net retention (or net line). A typical reinsurance contract between two insurance companies is called treaty reinsurance, which involves an automatic sharing of the risks assumed. In a reinsurance agreement, the insurance company that transfers its loss exposure to another insurer is called the primary insurer.</p>
            <strong><li>Service Providers</li></strong>
            <p>Service providers sell medical and hospital care services to their subscribers, not insurance, in return for a premium payment. Benefits are in the form of services provided by the hospitals and physicians participating in the plan. They sell medical and hospital care services, not insurance. These services are packaged into various plans, and those who purchase these plans are known as subscribers.

                Another type of service provider is a health maintenance organization (HMO). HMOs offer a wide range of health care services to member subscribers. For a fixed periodic premium paid in advance of any treatment, subscribers are entitled to the services of specific physicians and hospitals contracted to work with the HMO. Unlike commercial insurers, HMOs provide financing for health care plus the health care itself. HMOs are known for stressing preventive health care and early treatment programs.
                
                The third type of service provider is the preferred provider organization (PPO). Under the usual PPO arrangement, a group desiring healthcare services (e.g., an employer or a union) will obtain price discounts or special services from certain select health care providers in exchange for referring its employees or members to them. PPOs can be organized by employers or by the health care providers themselves. The kind of services provided is spelled out in the contract between the employer and the health care professional (i.e., a physician or a hospital). Insurance companies can also contract with PPOs to offer services to insureds.</p>
            <strong><li>Fraternal Benefit Societies</li></strong>
        <p>Insurance is also issued by fraternal benefit societies, which have existed in the United States for more than a century. Fraternal societies, noted primarily for their social, charitable, and benevolent activities, have memberships based on religious, national, or ethnic lines. Fraternal first began offering insurance to meet their low-income members' needs, funding the benefits on a pure assessment basis. Today, few fraternal rely on an assessment system; most have adopted the same advanced funding approach other insurers use. To be characterized as a fraternal benefit society, the organization must be nonprofit, have a lodge system that includes ritualistic work, and maintain a representative form of government with elected officers. Fraternal must be formed for reasons other than obtaining insurance. Today, most fraternal benefit societies issue group insurance and annuities with many of the same provisions found in commercial insurers' policies. Fraternal benefit societies are more concerned about maintaining minimum reserves and surpluses for coverage than providing dividends or profits.</p>
        <strong><li>Lloyd's of London</li></strong>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lloyd's of London is not an insurer but rather a syndicate of individuals and companies that individually underwrite insurance. Lloyd's can be compared to the New York Stock Exchange, which provides the arena and facilities for buying and selling public stock. Lloyd's function is to gather and disseminate underwriting information, help its associates settle claims and disputes, and, through its member underwriters, provide coverages that might otherwise be unavailable in certain areas.</p>
        <strong><li>Self-Insurers</li></strong>
        <p>Though self-insurance is not a method of transferring risk, it is an important concept to understand. Rather than transfer risk to an insurance company, a self-insurer establishes a self-funded plan to cover potential losses. Large companies often use Self-insurance for funding pension plans and some health insurance plans. A self-insurer will often look to an insurance company to provide insurance above a specified maximum loss level. The self-insurer will bear the amount of loss below that maximum amount.</p>
        <strong><li>Captive Insurer</li></strong>
        <p>An insurer established and owned by a parent firm for the purpose of insuring the parent firm's loss exposure is known as a captive insurer.</p>
        <strong><li>An insurer established and owned by a parent firm for the purpose of insuring the parent firm's loss exposure is known as a captive insurer.</li></strong>
        <p>Surplus lines insurance is available to those who need protection, but it is not available through private or commercial carriers. Surplus lines insurance refers to the nontraditional insurance market. A person will seek coverage through a surplus lines broker in order to secure coverage for high, substandard, or unusual risks (i.e., hole-in-one insurance or nonappearance coverage). In order to qualify for surplus lines coverage, an effort has to be made to secure coverage in the authorized market. An individual may not attempt to secure coverage just because it may be less expensive.</p>
        <strong><li>Industrial Insurer</li></strong>
        <p>Insurance is also sold through a specialized branch of the industry known as home service or debit insurers. These companies specialize in a particular type of insurance called industrial insurance. Industrial insurance is characterized by relatively small face amounts (usually $1,000 to $2,000) with premiums paid weekly.</p>
        <strong><li>Private Versus Government as Insurer</li></strong>
        <p>Private citizens or groups own private or commercial insurance companies. They may be proprietary or cooperative. An example of a proprietary insurer would be a profit-motivated stock company. Private insurers offer individual, group, industrial, or blanket insurance policies.

            Federal and state governments are also insurers. Insurance provided by federal and state governments is commonly called social insurance programs. Social insurance programs range from crop insurance to bank and savings and loan deposit insurance. Government insurers are owned and operated by a Federal or State entity. Government insurers may either: (1) write insurance to cover perils that are not insurable by commercial insurers (i.e., war, flood, a nuclear reaction) or (2) write insurance on risks that are insurable and thus compete with the commercial marketplace (i.e., Social Insurance such as Workers' Compensation).
            
            Government insurers generally write insurance to cover catastrophic perils (i.e., flood) or to protect a segment of society (i.e., the elderly) against catastrophic medical costs (i.e., Medicare). These programs have far-reaching effects, with millions of people relying on these plans. Additional examples of social insurance programs include:
            
            Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI), commonly known as Social Security.
            Social Security Hospital Insurance (HI) and Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI), commonly known as Medicare.
            Medicaid
            Serviceman's Group Life Insurance (SGLI) and Veteran's Group Life Insurance (VGLI)
            National Flood Insurance Program, and Federal Crop Insurance Corporation
            As you can see, the government plays a vital role in providing social insurance programs. These programs pay billions of dollars in benefits every year and affect millions of people.</p>
        <strong><li>Insurer Classification According To Authorization</li></strong>
        <p>An insurer that is admitted or authorized to transact insurance business in a particular state is referred to as an authorized insurer in that state. Also known as admitted insurers, an authorized company is issued a certificate of authority. Generally, an unauthorized (non-admitted) insurance company is not permitted nor allowed to conduct insurance operations in a particular State. In some cases, a non-admitted insurer may still offer surplus lines insurance without a certificate of authority if no authorized insurer in the market is available or willing to take the risk. The surplus insurance market is heavily regulated, requires additional licensing, and typically does not offer the consumer the same protections as the primary insurance market.</p>
        <strong><li>Insurer Classification According To Domicile</li></strong>
        <p>A domestic insurer has its principal or home office in the state where it is authorized. In other words, an insurance company authorized (admitted to transact insurance business) in the state where it is chartered or incorporated is classified as a domestic insurer only in that state. A foreign insurer is authorized in one state, but its charter or principal office is in another State. An alien insurer is an insurer authorized in any state within the U.S., but its principal office is located outside this country.</p>
        <strong><li> Departments within an Insurance Company</li></strong>
        <p>Throughout this course, you will see references to different departments within an insurance company. The <strong>marketing</strong> or <strong> sales </strong> divisions are responsible for increasing the number of prospective applicants, thereby increasing the number of insureds, through various advertising mediums. The  <strong>sales</strong> department is typically the department completing the application and 1-1 appointments with prospective buyers. The <strong> underwriting </strong>department is responsible for reviewing applications, conducting investigations to gain additional information about applicants, assigning risk classifications, and approving or declining an application. The <srtong>claims</srtong> department is responsible for processing, investigating, and paying claims for losses incurred by insureds. The actuarial department calculates policy rates, reserves, and dividends and makes other applicable statistical studies and reports focusing on morbidity and mortality tables.</p>
        <strong><li>Producers</li></strong>
        <p>Producer refers to the full range of individuals who solicit insurance products to the public. The various types of producers include (1) Agents who represent the insurer which sponsors them; (2) Brokers who represent themselves and the insured (i.e., the client or customer); (3) Solicitors who represent and solicit insurance on behalf of an agent; and (4) Service Representatives who are employees of an insurer. Service representatives who do not engage in sales activities that pay commissions need not be licensed. If commissions are paid, the recipient must possess an insurance license. Any person who solicits or countersigns policies or collects premiums from policyowners must be licensed in most locales. Licensed producers are obligated to act in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of the insurers with which they place insurance business and the clients they represent in insurance transactions. Producers are typically considered to be part of the sales department.</p>
        <strong><li>Underwriter</li></strong>
        <p>Underwriter refers to the person who identifies, assesses, examines, and classifies the amount of risk represented by an applicant (proposed insured) to determine if coverage should be provided and, if so, at what cost (premium). An underwriter approves or declines insurance applications and determines the cost to provide insurance.</p>
        <strong><li>Actuary</li></strong>
        <p>Actuary refers to the person who calculates policy rates, reserves, and dividends and makes other applicable statistical studies and reports. The actuary is concerned about the cost of insurance as a whole or for a specific class of risk.</p>
        <strong><li>Adjuster</li></strong>
        <p>An insurance adjuster is a person who engages in investigative work to obtain information for adjusting, settling, or denying insurance claims. An insurance adjuster will primarily use claim forms, but depending on the claim, may also be involved with investigations into an insured's identity, habits, conduct, business, occupation, honesty, integrity, or credibility, etc. A public adjuster refers to a person who, for compensation, acts on behalf of or aids an insured with settling an insurance claim.</p>
        <strong><li>How Insurance is Sold</li></strong>
        <p>Most consumers purchase insurance through licensed producers who present insurers' products and services to the public via active sales and marketing methods. Insurance producers may be agents, who represent a particular company, or brokers, who are not tied to any particular company and can represent many insurers' products. In most states, brokers and agents must be contracted and appointed with an insurer prior to taking an application for the insurer. An agent has an agent's contract; a broker has a broker's contract. This contract and appointment with the insurance company are what grant the agent (or broker) authority to bind an insurer to an insurance contract. In a sales transaction, agents represent the insurer, and brokers represent the buyer. In any dispute between the insured or beneficiary and the insurer, the agent who solicits an insurance application represents the insurer and not the insured or beneficiary.

            Agents are also classified as captive or career agents and independent agents. A captive or career agent works for one insurance company and sells only that company's insurance policies. An independent agent works for himself and sells the insurance products of many companies. In most states, the agent may represent as many insurers as will appoint him. There are three systems that support the sale of insurance through agents and brokers. These are the career agency system, personal producing general agency system, and independent agency system.</p>
        <strong><li>Career Agency System</li></strong>
        <p>Career agencies are branches of major stock and mutual insurance companies that are contracted to represent an insurer in a specific area. In career agencies, insurance agents are recruited, trained, and supervised by either a manager-employee of the company or a general agent (GA) who has a vested right in any business written by the GA's agents. GAs may operate strictly as managers, or they may devote a portion of their time to sales. The career agency system focuses on building sales staff.</p>
        <strong><li>Managerial System</li></strong>
        <p>With the managerial system, branch offices are established in several locations. Instead of a general agent running the agency, a salaried branch manager is employed by the insurer. The branch manager supervises agents working out of that branch office. The insurer pays the branch manager's salary and pays him a bonus based on the amount and type of insurance sold and the number of new agents hired.</p>
        <strong><li>Personal Producing General Agency System</li></strong>
        <p>The personal producing general agency (PPGA) system is similar to the career agency system. However, PPGAs do not recruit, train, or supervise career agents. They primarily sell insurance, although they may build a small sales force to assist them. PPGAs are generally responsible for maintaining their own offices and administrative staff. Agents hired by a PPGA are considered employees of the PPGA, not the insurance company, and are supervised by regional directors.</p>
        <strong><li>Independent Agency System</li></strong>
        <p>The independent agency system, a creation of the property and casualty industry, does not tie a sales staff or agency to any one particular insurance company. Instead, independent agents represent any number of insurance companies through contractual agreements. They are compensated on a commission or fee basis for the business they produce. This system is also known as the American agency system.</p>
        <strong><li>Other Methods of Selling Insurance</li></strong>
        <p>While most insurance is sold through agents or brokers under the systems previously described, a large volume is also marketed through direct selling and mass marketing methods. With the direct selling method, the insurer deals directly with consumers by selling its policies through vending machines, advertisements, or salaried sales representatives. No agent or broker is involved. A large volume of insurance is also sold through mass marketing techniques, such as over the Internet, newspaper, magazine, radio, and television ads. Mass marketing methods provide exposure to large groups of consumers, often using direct selling methods with occasional follow-up by agents.

            Career Agencies recruit, train, and supervise agents through managers or general agents. They primarily build staff.
            Personal Producing General Agencies (PPGA) do not recruit, train, or supervise agents. They primarily sell insurance.
            Independent agents (American Agency System) represent any number of insurance companies through contractual agreements.</p>
        <strong><li>History of Regulation</li></strong>
        <p>1868-Paul v. Virginia. This case, which the U.S. Supreme Court decided, involved one state's attempt to regulate an insurance company domiciled in another state. The Supreme Court sided against the insurance company, ruling that the sale and issuance of insurance is not interstate commerce, thus upholding states' right to regulate insurance.</p>
        <strong><li> 1944-United States v. Southeastern Underwriters Association (SEUA). </li></strong>
        <p>The decision of Paul v. Virginia was held for 75 years before the Supreme Court again addressed the issue of state versus federal regulation of the insurance industry. In the SEUA case, the Supreme Court ruled that the insurance industry is a form of interstate commerce. As such, the insurance industry should be regulated by the federal government and subject to a series of federal laws, many of which conflicted with existing state laws. This decision did not affect states' power to regulate insurance, but it did nullify state laws that conflicted with federal legislation. The result of the SEUA case was to shift the balance of regulatory control to the federal government.</p>
        <strong><li>1945-The McCarran-Ferguson Act.</li></strong>
        <p>The turmoil created by the SEUA case prompted Congress to enact Public Law 15, the McCarran-Ferguson Act. This law made it clear that the states' continued regulation of insurance was in the public's best interest. However, it also made possible the application of federal antitrust laws to the extent that [the insurance business] is not regulated by state law. This act led each state to revise its insurance laws to conform to the federal laws. Today, the insurance industry is considered to be state regulated. Any person who violates the McCarran-Ferguson act faces a fine of $10,000 or up to one year in jail.</p>
        <strong><li>1958-intervention by the FTC.</li></strong>
        <p> In the mid-1950s, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sought to control the health insurance industry's advertising and sales literature. In 1958 the Supreme Court held that the McCarran-Ferguson Act disallowed such supervision by the FTC, a federal agency. Additional attempts have been made by the FTC to force further federal control, but none have been successful.</p>
        <strong><li>1959-intervention by the SEC. </li></strong>
        <p>In this instance, the issue was variable annuities: Is a variable annuity an insurance product that should be regulated by the states or a securities product that should be regulated federally by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)? The Supreme Court ruled that federal securities laws applied to insurers that issued variable annuities and, thus, required these insurers to conform to both SEC and state regulation. The SEC also regulates variable life insurance.</p>
        <strong><li> 1970-Fair Credit Reporting Act.</li></strong>
        <p>In an attempt to protect an individual's right to privacy, the federal government passed the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which is the authority that requires fair and accurate reporting of information about consumers, including applications for insurance. Insurers must inform applicants about any investigations that are being made upon completion of the application. If any consumer report is used to deny coverage or charge higher rates, the insurer must furnish to the applicant the name of the reporting agency conducting the investigation.</p>
        <strong><li>1994-United States Code (USC) Sections 1033 and 1034.</li></strong>
        <p> According to 18 U.S.C. § 1033 AND 1034, it is a criminal offense for an individual who has been convicted of a felony involving dishonesty or breach of trust to willfully engage or participate (in any capacity) in the business of insurance without first obtaining a "Letter of Written Consent to Engage in the Business of Insurance" from the regulating insurance department of the individual's state of residence.

            The Fraud and False Statements federal law makes it illegal to lie, falsify, or conceal information (orally or in writing) from a federal official. As it applies to insurance, any person engaged in interstate insurance business who engages in intentional unfair or deceptive insurance practices or overvalues an insurance product in a financial report or document presented to a regulatory official, will violate federal law. Other violations include but are not limited to embezzling money from an insurance company, misappropriating insurance premiums, and writing threatening letters to insurance offices.
            
            The punishment for violation is a fine of up to $50,000, imprisonment up to 15 years, and license revocation.
            An individual convicted of a felony involving dishonesty may engage in insurance business ONLY after receiving written consent from the state insurance regulatory agency and a 1033 waiver.</p>
        <strong><li> Chapter Summary</li></strong>
        <p>Insurance is the transfer of risk from one party to another through a legal contract or the transfer of risk through the pooling (accumulation) of funds.
            The benefit of insurance is that most contracts offered to individuals and organizations in society, including health, property, and casualty policies, are contracts of indemnity whose primary purpose is to pay off financial losses and reimburse the insured.
            Insurance evolved to produce a practical solution to economic uncertainties and losses.
            Companies that sell more than one line of insurance are known as multi-line insurers.
            Stockholders may or may not be policyholders.
            Life insurance creates an instant estate, regardless of when death occurs.
            There are two types of insurance companies: Private vs. Government insurance.
             <strong>stock insurance company</strong> typically issues nonparticipating insurance policies.
            <strong><p>Non Participating policies</strong> do not allow policyholders to participate in board elections or dividends and instead aim to increase profit for the shareholders.</p>
            <strong><p> Mutual companies</strong> are referred to as participating companies because the policyowners participate in dividends.</p>
           <srtong><p>Participating policies</srtong>  allow policyholders to participate in the company by electing the board of directors and receiving dividends from the divisible surplus.</p>
            <strong><p>The divisible surplus</strong> is the amount of earnings paid to policyowners as dividends after the insurance company sets aside funds required to cover reserves, operating expenses, and general business purposes.</p>
            <strong><p>pure assessment mutual company</strong> operates on the basis of loss-sharing by group members.</p>
