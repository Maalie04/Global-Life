        <strong><li>Industrial life insurance</li></strong>
        <p>
          issues very small face amounts, such as $1,000 or $2,000. Premiums are
          paid weekly and collected by debit agents. They were designed for
          burial coverage.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Ordinary Life Insurance</li></strong>
        <p>
          is life insurance of commercial companies not issued on the weekly
          premium basis. It is made up of several types of individual life
          insurance, such as temporary (term), permanent (whole).
        </p>
        <strong><li>Group Life Insurance</li></strong>
        <p>
          is insurance written for members of a group, such as a place of
          employment, association, or a union. Coverage is provided to the
          members of that group under one master contract. The group is
          underwritten as a whole, not on each individual member. One of the
          benefits of group life coverage is usually there is no evidence of
          insurability required.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Term life insurance</li></strong>
        <p>
          gives you the greatest amount of coverage for a limited period of
          time. Term insurance is only good for a limited period of time because
          it has a TERMination date. Term insurance is an inexpensive type of
          insurance, making it an attractive option for large policies. Term
          life is the CHEAPEST type of pure life insurance, and due to having a
          termination date and not having any cash value, it will ALWAYS be
          cheaper than a whole life policy with the same face value. It provides
          a pure death protection since it only pays a death benefit if the
          insured dies during the policy term.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Level term</li></strong>

        <ul>
          <p>
            Level term is also called level premium level term, has a level face
            amount and level premiums. Premiums tend to be higher than annual
            renewable term because they are level throughout the policy period.
            However, the premiums will increase at each renewal. Life insurance
            written to cover a need for a specified period of time at the lowest
            premium is called Level Term Insurance. Term insurance always
            expires at the end of the policy period. For example, if D needs
            life insurance that provides coverage for the remainder of her
            working years and wants to pay as little as possible, D would need
            Level term. Level term provides a fixed, low premium in exchange for
            coverage which lasts a specified time period.
          </p>
        </ul>

        <strong><li>Decreasing term</li></strong>

        <ul>
          <p></p>
        </ul>
        Decreasing term is term life insurance that provides an annually
        decreasing face amount over time with level premiums. These policies are
        usually used for mortgage protection. A decreasing term policy is a type
        of life policy which has a death benefit that adjusts periodically
        (according to a schedule) and is written for a specific period of time.
        Decreasing term policies are usually written for a mortgage or other
        debt that typically decreases over time until it is paid off. For
        example, a 15 year decreasing term policy could protect a 15-year
        mortgage. As the mortgage balance reduces each year, the face value of
        the insurance policy will adjust accordingly to match. After the
        mortgage is paid off, the insurance policy will expire.

        <strong><li>Credit policies</li></strong>

        <p>
          Credit policies are typically purchased using a decreasing term life
          insurance policy, with the term matched to the length of the loan
          period and the decreasing insurance amount matched to the declining
          loan balance. Since Credit life insurance is designed to cover the
          life of a debtor and pay the amount due on a loan if the debtor dies
          before the loan is repaid, credit policies can only be purchased for
          up to the amount of the debt or loan outstanding. For example, if you
          wanted an insurance policy to protect a $20,000, 5-year auto loan, you
          would use a 5-year decreasing term life insurance policy with an
          initial face value of $20,000. You will pay the same level premium
          every month for the 5-year term of the policy. The face value will
          start out at $20,000 and change according to a schedule (the
          decreasing balance of the auto loan). After 5 years, the car will be
          paid for and the insurance policy will no longer be needed.
        </p>

        <strong><li>Increasing term</li></strong>

        <ul>
          <p>
            Increasing term is term life insurance that provides an increasing
            face amount over time based on specific amounts or a percentage of
            the original face amount.
          </p>
        </ul>

        <strong><li>Convertible term</li></strong>

        <ul>
          <p>
            Convertible term is a provision that allows policyowners to convert
            their term insurance into permanent policies without showing proof
            of insurability. Convertible Term provides temporary coverage that
            may be changed to permanent coverage without evidence of
            insurability. For example, if you take out a term insurance policy
            when you are young to take advantage of your good health and the
            policy's lower premium, but want the option convert the policy to a
            permanent one for final expense benefits once your finances improve,
            you would want a convertible term life policy. The conversion
            privilege of a group term life policy allows an individual to leave
            the group term (temporary) plan and convert his or her insurance to
            an individual (permanent) policy without providing evidence of
            insurability. The most important factor to consider when determining
            whether to convert term insurance at the insured's attained age or
            the insured's original age is the premium cost. The number one
            factor which impacts life insurance premium cost is the insureds
            current or attained age. For example, a $25,000 policy on a healthy
            7-year-old boy will cost substantially less than a $25,000 policy on
            a 57-year-old man. Whether converting an individual or group term
            insurance policy, although your insurability is guaranteed, your age
            is typically reevaluated to your current (attained) age, not left at
            the age you were when you applied for the original term policy.
            Convertible Term would allow you to take your temporary coverage and
            change it to permanent coverage without evidence of insurability or
            good health, but your premiums will increase due to using your
            attained age.
          </p>
        </ul>

        <strong><li>Renewable term</li></strong>

        <ul>
          <p>
            Renewable term is term insurance that guarantees the insured the
            right to continue term coverage after expiration of the initial
            policy period without having to prove insurability. For example, if
            you have a 10-year renewable and convertible term; After the 10
            years are up, the policy terminates or you can renew it. If you
            renew it the premium price will go up, and you will have the policy
            for another 10 years. This cycle continues until you are too old to
            renew or it's too expensive. All TERM insurance has a final
            TERMINATION date where you can no longer renew it.
          </p>
        </ul>

        <strong><li>Annual renewable term</li></strong>

        <p>
          Annual renewable term is term coverage that provides a level face
          amount that renews annually. This type of coverage is guaranteed
          renewable annually without proof of insurability.
        </p>

        <strong><li>Term Rider</li></strong>

        <p>
          A Term Rider is a type of life insurance product which covers children
          under their parent's policy. Family plan policies usually cover the
          family head with permanent insurance, and the coverage on the spouse
          and children is term insurance in the form of a rider. A term rider is
          always level term. This is cheaper than every family member getting
          their own policy. For example, the main policy may be on Dad, then mom
          and the children are riding on (attached to) dad's policy as term
          riders. Term riders allow for additional family members to be covered
          under one policy by attaching everyone to a main policy. Term riders
          can also allow an applicant to have excess coverage by adding an
          additional term rider for them to the main policy.
        </p>

        <strong><li>Whole life insurance</li></strong>
        <p>
          provides death benefits for the entire life of the insured. It also
          provides living benefits in the form of cash values. It matures at age
          100 and normally has a level premium. All whole life has the same type
          of benefits. The only difference in "types" of whole life is how the
          policy is paid. Some will be paid straight until death or age 100,
          some will be paid for after a few years or by a specific age, some may
          give you a little discount in the early years to help you get started,
          etc. All whole life lasts until death or age 100, has a fixed premium,
          and level benefit with cash value accumulation, regardless of how it
          is paid. Whole life is often compared to BUYING; like BUYING a house.
        </p>

        <strong><li>Straight Life insurance</li></strong>
        <p>
          premiums are payable throughout the insured's lifetime, and coverage
          continues until the insured's death. Said differently, premiums are
          payable as long as coverage is in force. Like all other whole life
          policies, straight whole life provides fixed premiums, a level death
          benefit, and cash value. Whole life also requires the face amount to
          be paid out to the insured at age 100 (when the policy matures),
          provided a death benefit has not already been paid. If G wants a
          policy with a fixed level premium and a benefit that pays out at death
          or age 100, G would want a whole life policy. Straight whole life
          allows you to maintain coverage throughout your entire lifetime and
          spread the cost out over your entire life.
        </p>
        <strong><li>Limited Pay</li></strong>
        <p>
          the coverage remains on a limited-pay life policy until age 100 or
          death, whichever happens first. Even though the premium payments are
          limited to a certain period, the insurance protection extends until
          the insured's death, or to age 100. For example, if you were to
          purchase a 20-pay policy, premiums would need to be paid for 20
          consecutive years. After that, you would not be required to make any
          additional premium payments, and your coverage would be guaranteed
          until death or age 100. A 40-year old applicant who would like to
          retire at age 70 and wants a policy with level premiums, permanent
          protection, and premiums paid up at retirement would also choose a
          paid-up-at age-70 limited pay policy. A limited pay life insurance
          policy covers an insured's whole life with level premiums paid over a
          limited time
        </p>

        <strong><li>Modified</li></strong>

        <p>
          is a policy where the premium stays fixed for the first 5 years, and
          then increases in year 6 and stays level for the remainder of the
          policy. Modified whole life has all of the same features of any other
          whole life except the insurance company cuts you a break on premium
          for the first few years. For example, K wants to buy life insurance
          because she knows it is cheaper when she is young. However, she is a
          college student and cannot afford the large premium associated with
          whole Life. The insurance company may offer her a Modified whole life
          to lock in her age and provide her all of the benefits of whole life,
          but give her a discount on premium while she is in college. After the
          first five years of the policy, she will be out of school and be able
          to afford the normal premium cost. Modified Whole Life describes a
          whole life policy with a premium that increases once after the first
          few years and then remains level for the remainder of the policy.
        </p>

        <strong><li>Modified Endowment Contract (MEC)</li></strong>

        <p>
          is best described as a policy that exceeds the maximum amount of
          premium that can be paid into a policy and still have it recognized as
          a life insurance contract. A MEC does not meet the 7-pay test and is
          considered over-funded, according to the IRS. For that reason, the
          policy will lose favorable tax treatment. The test is designed to
          discourage premium schedules that would result in a paid-up policy
          before the end of a seven-year period. For example, if your annual
          premium for a policy was $1,000 and you paid $20,000 in the first five
          years, you will have failed the 7-pay test by exceeding $7,000 (7-
          years times one year of premium). Said differently, you have exceeded
          the maximum amount of premium that can be paid into a policy and still
          have it recognized as a life insurance contract.
        </p>

        <strong><li>Joint Life policy</li></strong>

        <p>
          covers the lives of 2 individuals and save on premium cost by
          averaging the ages of the two insureds. Joint Life policies pay the
          face amount after the first person covered on the policy dies. This is
          similar to a Joint Checking account. The policy is shared between two
          people, and when one person dies, the other receives the entire
          account. If B and M were insured under a joint life policy and B were
          to die, M would receive the entire benefit and would also no longer be
          insured. A policy that promises to pay the face amount on the death of
          the first of 2 lives covered by the policy is called a Joint Life
          Policy.
        </p>

        <strong><li>Joint Survivor or Last Survivor Life Policies</li></strong>

        <p>
          cover the lives of two individuals and saves on premium costs by
          averaging the ages of the two insureds. Joint Life Survivor or Last
          Survivor policies only pay the death benefit upon the death of the
          last insured person. For example, say B and M purchase a joint life
          survivor policy. If B were to die first and then M died 10 years
          later, no benefits would be paid out from the policy until M died. A
          Joint Life and Survivor policy covers two lives but only pays benefits
          after the death of the last insured.
        </p>

        <strong><li>Family Maintenance policy</li></strong>

        <p>
          pays a monthly income from the date of death of the insured to the end
          of the preselected period. The payment of the face amount of the
          policy is payable at the end of such preselected period. If P is
          looking to purchase a life insurance policy that will pay a stated
          monthly income to his beneficiaries for 20 years after he dies and a
          lump sum of $20,000 at the end of that 20- year period, he should
          purchase a Family Maintenance policy. Family maintenance policies
          provide an income for a specific period starting at the death of the
          insured.
        </p>

        <strong><li>Family Income policies</li></strong>

        <p>
          pay an income beginning at the insured's death and continues for a
          period specified from the date of policy issue. For example, G
          purchased a Family Income policy at age 40, with a 20-year rider
          period. If G were to die at age 50, G's family would receive an income
          for 10 years.
        </p>

        <strong><li>Adjustable Life policy</li></strong>

        <p>
          owner is usually looking for a policy offering flexible premiums. As
          financial needs and objectives change, the policyowner can make
          adjustments to the premium and/or face amount of an Adjustable Life
          insurance policy. Adjustable life policies are able to provide these
          features by combining whole life and term life into a single plan. If
          a policyowner was looking for a policy in which they could control the
          amount and frequency of payments with a death benefit that can be
          adjusted as their life needs change, they would want an adjustable
          life policy. There typically are no dividends involved with adjustable
          life policies. Increasing the face amount may require a policyowner to
          provide proof of insurability. Usually, a customer with an Adjustable
          life policy has a special need for flexible premiums.
        </p>

        <strong><li>Universal life insurance policy</li></strong>

        <p>
          incorporates flexible premiums and an adjustable death benefit. The
          investment gains from a Universal Life Policy usually go toward the
          cash value. The policyowner can use the cash value to manipulate the
          flexible aspects of a universal life insurance policy. A customer who
          wants a policy that gives them the most options and the most control
          would be looking for a Universal Life Policy. Universal policies use
          gains to fund the cash value and give the policyowner options for
          flexible premiums and adjustable death benefits.
        </p>

        <strong><li>Variable life insurance policies</li></strong>

        <p>
          require a producer to have proper FINRA and National Association of
          Securities Dealers (NASD) securities registration prior to selling any
          variable policy contract, whether it be life insurance or an annuity,
          as they include regulated securities. These policies are also known as
          interest sensitive policies. The policies usually have a fixed level
          premium, but the cash value and death benefits of a Variable Life
          policy can fluctuate according to the performance of its underlying
          investment portfolio. A typical Variable Life Policy investment
          account grows through mutual funds, stocks, and bonds. This includes
          Variable Life, Universal Variable life, Variable Whole Life, and
          Variable Annuity. If a policyowner or applicant was looking for a
          policy to offset inflation, they would want to look into a variable
          policy. Since the policyowner is assuming all of the investment risk
          and the rate of return is not guaranteed, a person must have proper
          FINRA securities registration in addition to an insurance license to
          sell any variable contracts.
        </p>

        <strong><li>Variable Universal Whole Life, (VUL)</li></strong>

        <p>
          the policyowner controls the investment of cash values and selects the
          timing and amount of premium payments. Variable Universal Life
          policies give a policy owner the best of both Variable Life and
          Universal Life. If a policy owner was looking for a policy that
          allowed them to control how much and when premium was due, what
          investment accounts were used for funding, and where the returns from
          those investment accounts went, they would be looking for a Variable
          Universal Life Policy. The policy owner can control the timing and
          amount of premium payments, as well as the investment of cash values
          with a Variable Universal Life Policy.
        </p>

        <strong><li>Equity Index Universal Life Insurance</li></strong>

        <p>
          Equity Index Universal Life Insurance or Equity Indexed Life combines
          most of the features, benefits and security of traditional life
          insurance with the potential of earned interest based on the upward
          movement of an equity index. Unlike, a traditional whole life plan,
          this plan allows policyholders to link accumulation values to an
          outside equity index like S&P 500. 80% to 90% of the premium is
          invested in traditional fixed income securities and the remainder of
          the premium is invested in contracts tied to a stipulated stock index.
        </p>

        <p>
          These policies are characterized by a guaranteed minimum interest
          rate, tax deferral of interest accumulations, and policy loan access.
          The equity index returns are designed to keep pace with or beat
          inflation which protects the policyholder against downside market
          risk. Equity indexed life insurance contracts combine term life
          insurance with an investment feature, similar to a universal life
          plan. Death benefit amounts are based upon the coverage amount
          selected by the contract owner plus the account value.
        </p>

        <strong

            investor (or stranger) originated life insurance policy S(I)OLI
          </li></strong
        >

        <p>
          when the insured dies, the policyowner (investor) benefits. In normal
          circumstances, it is a beneficiary with insurable interest who
          benefits from the death of an insured. An investor originated life
          insurance policy is when an investor purchases a policy on the life of
          someone else to profit upon that person's death. The investor is
          typically the policyowner, payor, and names themselves beneficiary.
          Usually, this is in exchange for a monetary living benefit for the
          insured. For example, L, the Investor, has taken out a $100,000 life
          insurance policy on E, the insured. L is the policyowner who will
          receive the $100,000 upon E's death. E is the insured, and in exchange
          for allowing the policy on his life, receives $500 a month to help
          with bills. Investor or Stranger Originated Life Insurance Policies
          are illegal, as they are designed to circumvent the insurable interest
          requirements of an insurance contract and position the policyowner to
          benefit upon the death of the insured.

        <strong><li>Cash Value</li></strong>

        <p>
          is the equity amount or "savings" accumulation in a whole life policy.
        </p>

        <strong><li>Endowment Policy</li></strong>

        <p>
          is a contract providing for payment of the face amount at the end of a
          fixed period, at a specified age of the insured, or at the insured's
          death before the end of the stated period.
        </p>

        <strong><li>face amount plus cash value policy</li></strong>

        <p>
          is a contract that promises to pay at the insured's death the face
          amount of the policy plus a sum equal to the policy's cash value.
        </p>

        <strong><li>Juvenile Insurance</li></strong>

        <p>
          is written on the lives of children who are within specified age
          limits and generally under parental control.
        </p>

        <strong><li>Non-Medical Life Insurance</li></strong>

        <p>
          typically does not require a medical exam and tends to be more
          expensive than medically underwritten policies. The insurer will
          average out everyone's risk and charge accordingly. Although insurers
          typically will not require a medical exam, they will still inquire
          about the applicant's medical history and lifestyle.
        </p>

        <strong><li>Target premium</li></strong>

        <p>
          is a suggested premium used in Universal Life policies. It does not
          guarantee there will be adequate funds to maintain the policy to any
          time, especially to life. It may give an indication of what will be
          needed (under conservative estimates), to maintain the policy.
